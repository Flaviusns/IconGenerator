# IconGenerator

Icon Sizes Generator it´s a program that can be use to generate the icons for your app in iOS and Android.

The input image  it´s recomendable to be a .png and a 1024x1024 originial size for better results.

We are not responsible for possible problems in your system, you accept the program as it is.

Java it´s required.

Javafx it´s requiered too.

Installers no more supported.
 
Now we use the app itself, like an .app for macOS and a .exe for windows (available soon). For linux based system you can use java -jar in terminal to execute the jar file. The jar file is always available.
